content: "ZenML ensures workflow portability across different environments and supports easy migration between cloud providers. Databricks is available on AWS, Azure, and GCP, but workflows remain deeply tied to Databricks-specific constructs (workspaces, clusters, jobs, Unity Catalog), reducing portability compared to a tool-agnostic pipeline layer like ZenML."
