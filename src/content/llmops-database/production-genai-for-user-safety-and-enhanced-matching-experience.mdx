summary: "Tinder implemented two production GenAI applications to enhance user safety and experience: a username detection system using fine-tuned Mistral 7B to identify social media handles in user bios with near-perfect recall, and a personalized match explanation feature using fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B to help users understand why recommended profiles are relevant. Both systems required sophisticated LLMOps infrastructure including multi-model serving with LoRA adapters, GPU optimization, extensive monitoring, and iterative fine-tuning processes to achieve production-ready performance at scale."

<p>Tinder's comprehensive GenAI implementation represents a significant production deployment of large language models at scale, serving 47 million monthly active users across 47 languages. The company has moved beyond experimental applications to deliver real business value through two primary GenAI use cases that demonstrate sophisticated LLMOps practices.<br><br>The first production system addresses username detection from user bios, a critical trust and safety challenge. Tinder faces the common problem of bad actors attempting to redirect users off-platform by including social media handles like Snapchat or OnlyFans in their profiles. This creates poor user experiences and brand risk. The technical challenge is particularly complex because it requires extremely high precision to avoid flagging legitimate users, must work across 47 different languages and character sets, and needs to adapt to evolving adversarial patterns as bad actors modify their approaches to circumvent detection.<br><br>Tinder's solution involves fine-tuning a Mistral 7B model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques. The initial training dataset consisted of 2,000 manually curated flagged bios that were processed through larger LLMs and then manually reviewed to ensure high quality. The results demonstrate the significant value of fine-tuning over off-the-shelf solutions. Their previous rule-based system achieved only 33% recall at 98% precision, while off-the-shelf models improved recall to 84-88%. However, the fine-tuned model achieved near-perfect recall of nearly 100% while maintaining the required high precision, representing a dramatic improvement in system effectiveness.<br><br>The second major GenAI application focuses on generating personalized match explanations, leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs rather than just classification tasks. The goal is to help users understand why a recommended profile might be interesting and relevant by analyzing the rich profile information including bios, interests, relationship intent, lifestyle values, preferences, and insights. This feature aims to position Tinder as a "mutual friend" that can naturally explain connection possibilities in human-like language.<br><br>The technical requirements for this system are particularly challenging from an LLMOps perspective. The system must provide personalized explanations rather than generic summaries, adhere to specific style guidelines including tone, length, and policy alignment, maintain authenticity without hallucination or exaggeration, and be both engaging and appropriate. These subjective requirements like being "fun and engaging but not cheesy" represent the type of nuanced challenges that traditional ML systems struggle with but that require sophisticated prompt engineering and fine-tuning approaches.<br><br>The match explanation system uses a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B model with LoRA adapters, employing both Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) strategies depending on the training stage. The development process was highly iterative, involving five to six rounds of refinement. Each iteration began with generating approximately 500 sample outputs using LLMs, followed by manual rewrites and feedback from content writers and product managers, then fine-tuning and evaluation. This iterative approach also included extensive work on edge case handling and policy adherence.<br><br>For evaluation, Tinder employed modern techniques including using LLMs as judges alongside traditional industry-standard evaluation methods. The results show significant improvements through fine-tuning. Hallucination rates decreased from 26% with off-the-shelf models to 16% after the first fine-tuning iteration with just 500 samples, and eventually down to approximately 1% after multiple iterations. Coherence, measuring whether outputs make sense and follow desired tone, style, and length, improved to 94% through fine-tuning, addressing a known weakness of off-the-shelf models in following specific stylistic guidelines.<br><br>The production infrastructure demonstrates sophisticated LLMOps practices for serving these models at scale. Tinder chose to self-host open-source LLMs for three primary reasons: privacy concerns when dealing with user data, better control and faster iteration capabilities for models trained on user data, and cost considerations given the expensive nature of GenAI inference. The username detection system processes approximately 2 million predictions daily and flags over 260,000 profiles, requiring efficient multi-model serving capabilities.<br><br>For the username detection use case, Tinder deployed multiple LoRA adapters focusing on different profile components like job, bio, and name, all sharing a single base model. They utilize Lorax, an open-source framework that enables concurrent serving of multiple adapters in a single batch without losing throughput. This architecture allows dynamic loading of new adapters without full model redeployment, providing crucial flexibility for adapting to evolving adversarial patterns while maintaining cost efficiency through shared base model infrastructure.<br><br>The match explanation system required careful optimization for real-time serving with approximately 300 input tokens and 100 output tokens per request. Tinder conducted extensive GPU benchmarking and found that L40S GPUs provided the best cost-latency trade-off, achieving 2.1-second P50 latency and daily costs of $3.5K for 600 QPS requirements, outperforming even A100 GPUs in their specific use case.<br><br>Production challenges highlighted several unique aspects of LLMOps compared to traditional ML systems. Cold start problems are particularly acute with heavy LLM models, requiring fixed warm pools and strategic pre-warming strategies. GPU autoscaling presents additional complexity compared to CPU workloads, sometimes necessitating over-provisioning to handle anticipated traffic patterns. The unpredictable nature of LLM outputs requires comprehensive monitoring and observability systems, including post-processing checks for token repetition, unexpected formatting, oversized or undersized outputs, and user feedback mechanisms.<br><br>Tinder also evaluated Predibase's enterprise Lorax solution, achieving 2x cost and latency reduction compared to open-source Lorax through features like TurboLoRA and quantization. The unified training and serving stack provided faster iteration cycles from fine-tuning to deployment, along with round-the-clock support that the team particularly valued for production operations.<br><br>The implementation reveals several important lessons about production GenAI systems. Fine-tuning consistently delivers significant performance improvements and domain alignment over off-the-shelf models, even with relatively small datasets. GenAI applications extend beyond generative use cases to optimization of existing deep learning and computer vision systems, with LLMs serving as powerful backbone networks. However, deploying these models introduces new operational challenges requiring specialized tools and solutions, with substantial cost implications that necessitate careful optimization of model selection, fine-tuning approaches, and inference infrastructure.<br><br>The scale of Tinder's deployment, serving millions of users daily across multiple languages while maintaining high precision and low latency requirements, demonstrates the maturity of their LLMOps practices. The iterative development process, comprehensive evaluation frameworks, sophisticated serving infrastructure, and robust monitoring systems represent best practices for production GenAI applications in consumer-facing products where reliability and user experience are paramount.<br></p>
