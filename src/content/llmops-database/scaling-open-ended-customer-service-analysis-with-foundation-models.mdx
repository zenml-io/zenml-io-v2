## Overview

MaestroQA is a company focused on augmenting call center operations through quality assurance (QA) processes and customer feedback analysis. Their platform serves enterprise clients across multiple industries including ecommerce, healthcare, fintech, insurance, and education. The core challenge they addressed was enabling their customers to analyze high volumes of unstructured customer interaction data—call recordings, chat messages, and emails—at enterprise scale using large language models.

This case study, published in March 2025 on the AWS blog, details how MaestroQA integrated Amazon Bedrock to deliver their "AskAI" feature, which allows customers to run open-ended natural language queries across millions of customer interaction transcripts. The solution represents a significant evolution from their earlier keyword-based rules engine approach to semantic understanding powered by LLMs.

## The Problem Space

Before adopting LLMs, MaestroQA offered several analysis capabilities for customer interaction data. They developed proprietary transcription technology by enhancing open-source transcription models to convert call recordings to text. They integrated Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis, enabling customers to identify and sort interactions by customer sentiment. They also built a logic/keyword-based rules engine for classifying interactions based on factors like timing, process steps, Average Handle Time (AHT), compliance checks, and SLA adherence.

However, these approaches had fundamental limitations. Keyword-based systems could not understand semantic equivalence—phrases like "Can I speak to your manager?" and "I would like to speak to someone higher up" don't share keywords but express the same intent (requesting an escalation). MaestroQA's customers needed the ability to ask open-ended questions about their interaction data, such as "How many times did the customer ask for an escalation?" without having to enumerate every possible phrasing.

The scale requirement was equally challenging. MaestroQA's clients handle anywhere from thousands to millions of customer engagements monthly. Any solution needed to process this volume while maintaining acceptable latency and cost characteristics.

## Solution Architecture

MaestroQA's production LLM architecture centers on Amazon Bedrock integrated with their existing AWS infrastructure. The system flow works as follows:

When a customer submits an analysis request through MaestroQA's web application, an Amazon ECS cluster retrieves the relevant transcripts from Amazon S3 storage. The ECS service handles prompt cleaning and formatting before sending requests to Amazon Bedrock for analysis. Results are stored in a database hosted on Amazon EC2 for retrieval by the frontend application.

A notable architectural decision is their multi-model approach. MaestroQA offers customers the flexibility to choose from multiple foundation models available through Amazon Bedrock, including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku, Mistral 7b/8x7b, Cohere's Command R and R+, and Meta's Llama 3.1 models. This allows customers to balance performance requirements against cost considerations based on their specific use cases. The text doesn't detail specific prompt engineering strategies or how they determine which model to recommend for particular use cases, which would be valuable operational knowledge.

## Scaling and Infrastructure Considerations

The case study highlights cross-region inference as a critical operational capability. Originally, MaestroQA implemented their own load balancing, distributing requests between available US regions (us-east-1, us-west-2) for North American customers and EU regions (eu-west-3, eu-central-1) for European customers. They later transitioned to Amazon Bedrock's native cross-region inference capability, which reportedly enables twice the throughput compared to single-region inference.

Cross-region inference provides dynamic traffic routing across multiple regions, which is particularly valuable for handling demand fluctuations. The case study specifically mentions seasonal scaling challenges around holiday periods for ecommerce customers, where usage patterns become less predictable. The serverless nature of Amazon Bedrock eliminated the need for the team to manage hardware infrastructure or predict demand fluctuations manually.

For monitoring and reliability, MaestroQA uses Amazon CloudWatch to track their Bedrock-based system performance.

## Security and Compliance

The case study emphasizes several security and compliance considerations that are relevant to enterprise LLMOps deployments. Amazon Bedrock's security features ensure client data remains secure during processing and is not used for model training by third-party providers—a common enterprise concern with cloud-based AI services.

Geographic data controls were important for European customer expansion. Amazon Bedrock's availability in Europe combined with geographic control capabilities allowed MaestroQA to extend AI services to European customers without introducing additional operational complexity while adhering to regional data regulations (presumably GDPR, though not explicitly mentioned).

Authentication leverages existing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) infrastructure, allowing MaestroQA to use their existing authentication processes to securely invoke LLMs within Amazon Bedrock. This integration with existing security infrastructure reduces operational overhead for security management.

## Product Evolution and Incremental Deployment

The case study illustrates a pragmatic approach to LLM feature deployment. MaestroQA initially rolled out AskAI as a limited feature that allowed customers to run open-ended questions on a targeted list of up to 1,000 conversations. This constrained initial release allowed them to validate the approach, gather customer feedback, and understand the breadth of use cases before scaling.

Customer response validated the approach and revealed unexpected use cases. Beyond quality assurance, customers used the feature for analyzing marketing campaigns, identifying service issues, and discovering product opportunities. This customer discovery phase informed the decision to scale the feature to process millions of transcripts.

## Results and Claimed Benefits

The case study presents several customer success stories, though these should be evaluated with some caution as the source is a promotional AWS blog post:

A lending company uses MaestroQA to detect compliance risks across 100% of their conversations, reportedly achieving "almost 100% accuracy." Previously, compliance risk detection relied on agents manually raising internal escalations for customer complaints or vulnerable states, which was error-prone and missed many risks. The specific definition of "almost 100% accuracy" and how it was measured is not detailed.

A medical device company uses the service to analyze all conversations for FDA-required reporting of device issues. Previously they relied on agents to manually report customer-reported issues internally. The LLM-based approach provides a more comprehensive detection mechanism.

An education company replaced manual survey scores with automated customer sentiment scoring, increasing their sample size from 15% to 100% of conversations. This represents a significant operational efficiency gain, though the accuracy comparison between manual and automated scoring is not provided.

## Team and Development Considerations

The case study notes that MaestroQA operates with a "compact development team," and Amazon Bedrock's serverless architecture was valuable for rapid prototyping and refinement without infrastructure management overhead. The familiar AWS SDK and existing IAM integration reduced the learning curve and integration effort.

## Critical Assessment

While the case study presents a compelling narrative, several aspects deserve balanced consideration:

The performance claims (near 100% accuracy, 2x throughput) are presented without detailed methodology or independent verification. These metrics should be interpreted as marketing claims rather than rigorous benchmarks.

The multi-model offering is interesting from a product perspective, but the case study doesn't detail how customers should select between models or what the actual performance/cost tradeoffs look like in practice.

The transcription component uses proprietary technology built on enhanced open-source models, but details on accuracy, latency, and cost are not provided. Transcription quality directly impacts downstream LLM analysis quality.

There's no discussion of evaluation frameworks, prompt versioning, A/B testing, or other operational practices that would be relevant for maintaining LLM quality in production over time.

The case study doesn't address failure modes, fallback strategies, or how they handle cases where LLM responses are incorrect or uncertain. For compliance-critical applications like the lending and medical device examples, understanding error handling is particularly important.
