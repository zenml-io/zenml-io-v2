## Overview

Komodo Health, a healthcare data and analytics company, has developed and deployed MapAI, an NLP-based generative AI assistant embedded within their MapLab enterprise platform. The case study, authored by their Chief Technology Officer Laurent Bride, describes how this GenAI solution aims to democratize healthcare insight generation by enabling users of varying technical skill levels to interact with complex healthcare data through natural language queries.

The core business problem being addressed is the significant delay that non-technical team members in pharmaceutical organizations face when seeking data insights. According to Komodo, individuals such as brand leads, Medical Affairs managers, and clinical researchers often waited weeks or even months for data analytics to be delivered. MapAI is positioned as a solution that puts insight generation directly into the hands of these users, regardless of their technical expertise.

## Technical Architecture

The MapAI system employs a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that leverages NLP and generative AI capabilities. At its core, the system uses an intelligence agent that interprets the intent behind user queries and then delegates tasks to specialized GenAI agents. These specialized agents are capable of querying Komodo's extensive Healthcare Map, which the company describes as the industry's most comprehensive source of deidentified patient-level data.

### Model Selection and Experimentation

Komodo describes experimenting with several foundational models to identify the most suitable options for their specific healthcare use cases. The models they mention testing include:

- Llama 3.1 (Meta's open-source large language model)
- Mistral 7B (the 7-billion parameter model from Mistral AI)
- Phi-3 (Microsoft's smaller, efficient language model)

This experimentation phase suggests a thoughtful approach to model selection, considering factors such as performance, accuracy, and likely cost and latency trade-offs for their production workloads. The fact that they mention multiple models indicates they may be using different models for different tasks within their multi-agent system, though the specific production choices are not disclosed.

### API-First Development Approach

The case study emphasizes an API-first approach to development, which enables rapid agent development and seamless integration with the platform's comprehensive set of APIs. These APIs manage:

- User medical definitions
- Resource libraries
- Access to patient-centric insights from the Healthcare Map

This API-first architecture is notable from an LLMOps perspective as it allows for loose coupling between the GenAI layer and the underlying data infrastructure, making it easier to swap out or upgrade individual components without disrupting the entire system.

### Orchestration Framework

For deployment and orchestration of their LLM-powered agents, Komodo has implemented LangChain and LangGraph frameworks. LangChain is a widely-adopted framework for building applications with LLMs, providing abstractions for chains, agents, and tool use. LangGraph extends this with graph-based orchestration capabilities, which is particularly useful for complex multi-agent workflows where different specialized agents need to coordinate their actions.

The choice of these frameworks suggests a production-oriented approach that leverages established open-source tooling rather than building everything from scratch. This aligns with common LLMOps best practices around using proven orchestration tools.

### Automated LLM Lifecycle Management

One of the more significant LLMOps claims in the case study is that Komodo has "automated the entire LLM lifecycle." This is described as enabling the adoption of future foundational models, orchestration strategies, and training approaches. While the specific details of this automation are not provided, such automation typically encompasses:

- Model evaluation and testing pipelines
- Deployment automation
- Monitoring and observability
- Model versioning and rollback capabilities
- Performance benchmarking against new model releases

This level of automation is crucial for organizations that want to stay current with the rapidly evolving LLM landscape without incurring significant manual overhead each time they need to update or swap models.

## User Interface and Interaction Design

MapAI features a chat-style interface that enables self-service functionality. Users can pose questions in natural language (described as "layman's English") and receive data insights along with graphic visualizations. The system supports workflows such as:

- Querying diagnosis codes for specific conditions (e.g., NSCLC)
- Getting patient counts for specific diagnoses in given time periods
- Visualizing patient volume distribution by geography (zip3)
- Breaking down patient demographics by race, ethnicity, and payer
- Analyzing patient volume by healthcare provider (HCP) specialty
- Identifying top healthcare providers by patient volume in specific regions
- Building drug market baskets for specific conditions
- Querying treatment data (e.g., patients treated with specific drugs)

The ability to save cohorts and codesets for reuse in deeper analyses suggests a persistent context capability that allows users to build upon previous queries, which is an important feature for enterprise analytics workflows.

## Platform Integration

MapAI is not a standalone product but is integrated across multiple components of the MapLab platform:

- **MapExplorer**: A no-code workflow for generating high-level insights on diseases or therapeutic areas
- **MapView**: A no-code workflow that leverages saved cohort definitions and codesets with prebuilt dashboard templates for more complex analyses
- **MapLab Enterprise** (announced as coming soon): Will include no-code, low-code, and high-code environments for advanced users who want to build their own algorithms and models

This multi-tier approach to platform integration demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of different user personas and their varying technical capabilities, from business users who need simple natural language access to data scientists who require programmatic access.

## Critical Assessment

While the case study presents an ambitious and technically interesting approach to democratizing healthcare analytics through GenAI, several aspects warrant careful consideration:

**Claimed Benefits**: The assertion that users can move from weeks/months of waiting to quick insight generation is a significant claim. The actual performance and accuracy of such a system in production would depend heavily on the quality of the NLP understanding, the comprehensiveness of the specialized agents, and the robustness of the underlying data infrastructure.

**Model Selection Transparency**: While the case study mentions experimenting with multiple foundational models, it does not disclose which models are actually used in production or how they handle model updates and version management in practice.

**Evaluation and Quality Assurance**: The case study does not discuss how they evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the generated insights, which is a critical concern in healthcare settings where incorrect data interpretations could have significant consequences.

**Governance and Compliance**: Given that this is healthcare data (even if deidentified), questions around data governance, compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, etc.), and audit trails are not addressed in detail.

**Scalability and Performance**: No specific metrics are provided regarding system performance, latency, throughput, or how the system handles concurrent users at enterprise scale.

Despite these gaps, the case study represents a meaningful contribution to the LLMOps landscape in healthcare, demonstrating a production-oriented approach to deploying GenAI capabilities with a clear focus on enterprise integration and user accessibility. The combination of multi-agent architecture, API-first design, modern orchestration frameworks, and automated lifecycle management represents a mature approach to operationalizing LLMs in a complex domain.
