                <h2>The ZenML Advantage</h2>
                <p>Brevo's transition to ZenML marked a pivotal shift in how they approached machine learning. ZenML offered a suite of features that directly addressed Brevo's challenges.</p>
                <h3>Homogeneity of Infrastructure &amp; Centralization</h3>
                <p>Brevo deployed models using various tools within Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Vertex AI, BigQuery ML, and potentially Cloud Function. Despite their unique features, ZenML unified these tools for data scientists, maintaining agility and speed.</p>
