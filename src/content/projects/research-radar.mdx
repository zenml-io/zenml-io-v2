#### Classification Pipeline

Classifies articles using DeepSeek R1 and saves classification results for evaluation or dataset augmentation.

#### Training Pipeline

Fine-tunes ModernBERT for specialized article classification with comprehensive metrics tracking.

#### Comparison Pipeline

Compares the fine-tuned model against Claude Haiku to evaluate performance.

#### Deployment Pipeline

Deploys the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face for easy access and sharing.#### Stack Components

<ul><li><strong>Orchestrator:</strong> kubernetes</li><li><strong>Artifact Store:</strong> default</li><li><strong>Step Operator:</strong> default</li></ul>Research Radar automates research paper classification across multiple sources, helping researchers stay current with relevant publications without hours of manual filtering.

### What It Does

Provides an end-to-end pipeline that identifies specialized research papers through automated classification, demonstrated with an LLMOps use case that includes data ingestion, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

### How It Works

<ul>
<li>Classifies articles using the DeepSeek R1 model</li>
