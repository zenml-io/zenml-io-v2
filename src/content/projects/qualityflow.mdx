#### Generate & Evaluate Pipeline

Selects code, generates tests with LLM and baseline, runs them with coverage, and reports results.#### Stack Components

<ul><li><strong>Orchestrator:</strong> default</li><li><strong>Artifact Store:</strong> default</li></ul>QualityFlow is an AI-powered test generation pipeline that demonstrates how to
build production-ready workflows for automated unit test generation using
Large Language Models (LLMs) with ZenML. It focuses on generating tests,
comparing against a baseline, and producing real coverage analysis.

### What It Does

<ul>
<li>
<p>Integrates LLM providers (OpenAI/Anthropic) for intelligent unit test generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selects target source files via configurable strategies with max_files limits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generates baseline heuristic tests to compare with LLM-generated tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Executes tests and produces coverage metrics and detailed reports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tracks token usage and estimated costs via run metadata</p>
</li>
</ul>

### How It Works

<ul>
<li>
<p>A single Generate &amp; Evaluate pipeline orchestrates: input selection, source fetching,<br>
  code analysis, LLM test generation, baseline test generation, test execution with<br>
  coverage, and comparative reporting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses ZenML Path artifacts to support remote/containerized execution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configurable via YAML files to control speed, providers, and test limits</p>
</li>
</ul>

### Architecture

The architecture connects a streamlined test-generation pipeline to LLM providers and
test execution backends, producing coverage reports and markdown summaries that are
versioned and tracked in ZenML.
