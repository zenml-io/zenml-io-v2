#### ETL Pipeline

Pipeline that extracts raw ECB interest rate data, transforms and cleans it.

#### Feature Engineering Pipeline

Pipeline that augments the transformed dataset with additional features.

#### Model Training Pipeline

Pipeline that trains an XGBoost regression model and evaluates it for potential promotion.#### Stack Components

<ul><li><strong>Orchestrator:</strong> cloud-composer</li><li><strong>Artifact Store:</strong> gcs</li><li><strong>Step Operator:</strong> vertex-ai</li></ul>EuroRate Predictor transforms European Central Bank data into accurate interest rate forecasts, empowering financial decision-makers with reliable predictive insights.

### What It Does

EuroRate Predictor delivers production-ready interest rate forecasts through an enterprise-grade MLOps solution. It processes raw ECB data through automated pipelines that ensure data quality, feature richness, and model accuracy, making financial predictions accessible for both development and production environments.

### How It Works

<ul>
<li>Extracts raw interest rate data from authoritative European Central Bank sources</li>
<li>Transforms financial data through robust cleaning and standardization processes</li>
<li>Engineers domain-specific features optimized for time-series financial prediction</li>
<li>Trains advanced XGBoost regression models on Google's Vertex AI platform</li>
<li>Evaluates models rigorously to ensure prediction accuracy meets quality thresholds</li>
<li>Promotes only high-performing models to production automatically</li>
</ul>
