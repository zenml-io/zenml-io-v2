**Last updated:** November 3, 2022.

This release fixes some known bugs from previous releases and especially [0.5.5](https://blog.zenml.io/zero-five-six-release/2021-12-13-zero-five-five-release.md). Therefore, upgrading to 0.5.6 is a **breaking change**. You must do the following in order to proceed with this version:

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code class="language-bash" fs-codehighlight-element="code">
cd zenml_enabled_repo
rm -rf .zen/
</code></pre></div>

‍

And then start again with ZenML init:

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code class="language-bash" fs-codehighlight-element="code">
pip install --upgrade zenml
zenml init
</code></pre></div>

‍
