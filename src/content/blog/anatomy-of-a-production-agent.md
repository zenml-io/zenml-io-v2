The gap between a demo coding agent and a production one isn't features. It's failure handling, cost awareness, and the ability to stop, inspect, and resume at any point.

Here's the full pattern: the eight stages a coding agent goes through from issue to pull request, and what each stage actually requires from your infrastructure.

## The eight stages

### 1. Issue analysis

The agent reads the issue, understands the codebase context, and formulates a plan.

```python
@checkpoint
def analyze_issue(issue: str, codebase_context: str) -> AnalysisPlan:
    return call_llm(
        f"Analyze this issue and create a plan:\n{issue}\n\nContext:\n{codebase_context}"
    )
```

**Why this is a checkpoint:** This LLM call costs $0.50-$2.00 depending on context size, if the agent crashes later, you don't want to re-run this.

**Failure mode:** The LLM misunderstands the issue. Without a checkpoint, you'd never know and the agent could barrel ahead with a wrong plan.

### 2. Codebase exploration

The agent navigates the repo, it finds relevant files, understanding architecture, tracing dependencies.

```python
@checkpoint
def explore_codebase(plan: AnalysisPlan) -> ExplorationResult:
    files = search_codebase(plan.relevant_patterns)
    dependencies = trace_imports(files)
    return ExplorationResult(files=files, dependencies=dependencies)
```

**Why this is a checkpoint:** Exploration can involve dozens of file reads and searches. Caching this means replays skip straight to the result.

**Failure mode:** The agent misses a critical file. With a cached exploration result, you can inspect what it found and what it missed.

### 3. Plan formulation

The agent creates a concrete implementation plan that has steps for: which files to change, in what order, with what approach.

```python
@checkpoint
def create_plan(analysis: AnalysisPlan, exploration: ExplorationResult) -> ImplementationPlan:
    return call_llm(
        f"Create a detailed implementation plan:\n{analysis}\n\nCodebase:\n{exploration}"
    )
```

**Why this is a checkpoint:** The plan is the highest-leverage artifact. If the implementation goes wrong, you want to inspect the plan, not re-derive it.

### 4. Human approval

This is where most demo agents skip straight to writing code. Production agents don't.

```python
approved = kitaru.wait(
    schema=bool,
    question=f"Agent proposes: {plan.summary}. Approve?",
    metadata={"estimated_cost": plan.estimated_tokens},
)
if not approved:
    return "Plan rejected by reviewer."
```

**Why this matters:** The agent is about to spend $5-$20 writing and testing code. A 30-second human review of the plan saves hours of wasted compute. This isn't a nice-to-have; it's the difference between a useful tool and an expensive liability.

**Infrastructure requirement:** Real suspension. The process should stop, release compute, and resume when the human responds, whether that's 30 seconds or 3 days later.

### 5. Code generation

The agent writes code according to the approved plan.

```python
@checkpoint
def write_code(plan: ImplementationPlan) -> CodeChanges:
    changes = []
    for file_change in plan.changes:
        code = call_llm(f"Write this change:\n{file_change}")
        changes.append(code)
    return CodeChanges(changes=changes)
```

**Why this is a checkpoint:** This is usually the most expensive step because multiple LLM calls are involved, each generating code. Caching this is critical for cost control.

**Failure mode:** The generated code has a bug. With a checkpoint, you can replay from this point with a different prompt or model, keeping all the previous work.

### 6. Testing

The agent runs the test suite and interprets the results.

```python
@checkpoint
def run_tests(changes: CodeChanges) -> TestResult:
    applied = apply_changes(changes)
    result = run_test_suite(applied)
    return result
```

**Failure mode:** Tests fail. The agent now has a decision to make: fix the code or escalate. This is where most demo agents fall apart. A production agent with checkpointed state can loop back to step 5 with the test failure context, or escalate to a human with the full execution history.

### 7. Fix loop

If tests fail, the agent iterates. This is the part you absolutely cannot draw as a DAG.

```python
for attempt in range(max_attempts):
    if test_result.passed:
        break
    code = fix_code(code, test_result)
    test_result = run_tests(code)
```

Each iteration through this loop is checkpointed. If the agent crashes on attempt 3, it resumes from attempt 3; not from scratch.

### 8. PR creation and review

The agent packages the changes, writes a description, and creates a pull request.

```python
@checkpoint
def create_pr(changes: CodeChanges, plan: ImplementationPlan) -> str:
    description = call_llm(f"Write a PR description for:\n{plan.summary}")
    pr_url = create_pull_request(changes, description)
    return pr_url
```

## What the full flow looks like

Putting it all together:

```python
@flow
def coding_agent(issue: str) -> str:
    context = load_codebase_context()
    analysis = analyze_issue(issue, context)
    exploration = explore_codebase(analysis)
    plan = create_plan(analysis, exploration)

    approved = kitaru.wait(
        schema=bool,
        question=f"Approve plan: {plan.summary}?",
    )
    if not approved:
        return "Rejected."

    code = write_code(plan)
    test_result = run_tests(code)

    for attempt in range(3):
        if test_result.passed:
            break
        code = fix_code(code, test_result)
        test_result = run_tests(code)

    if not test_result.passed:
        return "Tests still failing after 3 attempts."

    return create_pr(code, plan)
```

That's normal Python. There's no graph, no YAML, and no special control flow. But every meaningful step is checkpointed, there's a human approval gate, and the whole thing survives crashes.

## What production requires that demos don't

Looking at this pattern, the requirements become clear:

**Checkpoint caching:** Each stage can cost $0.50-$5 in LLM tokens. Re-running from scratch on every failure is unacceptable.

**Real suspension:** The human approval step needs actual process suspension and not a polling loop burning compute while someone reviews a plan over lunch.

**Artifact inspection:** When something goes wrong at step 6, you need to look at what step 3 produced. Not a log line; the actual plan object.

**Replay from any point:** The fix loop failed after 3 attempts? Go back to step 5, swap in a different model, and try again. Don't re-run the whole agent.

**Cost tracking:** How much did this run cost? Which step was most expensive? Is attempt 3 of the fix loop worth it, or should the agent escalate?

These aren't nice-to-haves. They're the difference between a tool your team trusts and one they abandon after the first $200 surprise.
