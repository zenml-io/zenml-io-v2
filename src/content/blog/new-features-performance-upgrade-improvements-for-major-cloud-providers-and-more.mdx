We are thrilled to announce the release of **ZenML 0.74.0**, packed with exciting new features and improvements to make your ML workflows more efficient and user-friendly.

**Cloud Provider Integration Enhancements:** This release brings significant improvements to our cloud provider integrations, including [SageMaker pipeline scheduling capabilities](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks/stack-components/orchestrators/sagemaker#scheduling-pipelines), [implicit authentication for Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks/stack-components/container-registries/azure#authentication-methods), and [Vertex AI persistent resource support for step operators](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks/stack-components/step-operators/vertex#using-persistent-resources-for-faster-development). These enhancements make working with major cloud providers more seamless than ever.

**API Token Authentication:** We've introduced API Tokens to the dashboard, enabling secure and time-boxed authentication against our API. This feature provides better control over API access and enhances security by allowing you to create temporary, limited-scope access tokens for your automation needs.

**Platform Improvements:** This release includes comprehensive timezone handling improvements and enhanced database query performance. We've optimized queries for pipelines, run templates, models, and artifacts, while also improving the sorting and filtering capabilities across the platform. The Helm chart deployment process has been enhanced, and we've added [support for custom log formats](https://docs.zenml.io/concepts/steps_and_pipelines/logging#setting-logging-format).

**Bug Fixes and Documentation:** We've resolved several important issues, including fixes for the Kubernetes service connector and vLLM pipeline configurations. Our documentation has been expanded with [a new core concepts video](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/core-concepts) to help new users get started more easily.

**Conclusion** ZenML 0.74.0 focuses on improving cloud integrations, security, and overall platform stability. We encourage you to upgrade and explore these new features.
