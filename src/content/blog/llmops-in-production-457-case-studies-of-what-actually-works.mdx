Throughout 2024, we collated [a huge database of real-world LLMOps and GenAI case studies](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database), examining how companies actually implement and deploy large language models in production. Starting with around 300 entries and growing to 457 case studies by January 2025, [this collection](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database) represents over 600,000 words of technical implementation details, architectural decisions, and practical problem-solving approaches. To help practitioners navigate this wealth of information, we created a comprehensive series of thematic deep dives, each accompanied by an in-depth podcast episode powered by Google's NotebookLM.

Our journey began with "[Demystifying LLMOps](https://www.zenml.io/blog/demystifying-llmops-a-practical-database-of-real-world-generative-ai-implementations)", providing an essential overview of our database's methodology and structure, offering a practical starting point for those venturing into production LLM deployments. This foundation was expanded in "[LLMOps Lessons Learned](https://www.zenml.io/blog/llmops-lessons-learned-navigating-the-wild-west-of-production-llms)", which synthesized insights from our first 380 case studies to paint a broad picture of the current LLMOps landscape.

The technical series started with "[Building LLM Applications That Know What They're Talking About](https://www.zenml.io/blog/building-llm-applications-that-know-what-theyre-talking-about)", exploring the crucial role of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in creating knowledge-aware applications. This was followed by "[Building Advanced Search, Retrieval, and Recommendation Systems with LLMs](https://www.zenml.io/blog/building-advanced-search-retrieval-and-recommendation-systems-with-llms)", which explored the practical challenges and solutions in implementing embedding-based search systems.

For those interested in automation and orchestration, "[LLM Agents in Production](https://www.zenml.io/blog/llm-agents-in-production-architectures-challenges-and-best-practices)" offered a pragmatic examination of real-world agent deployments, while "[Prompt Engineering and Management in Production](https://www.zenml.io/blog/prompt-engineering-management-in-production-practical-lessons-from-the-llmops-database)" tackled the often-overlooked challenges of maintaining and scaling prompt infrastructure. Our "[Evaluation Playbook](https://www.zenml.io/blog/the-evaluation-playbook-making-llms-production-ready)" provided a comprehensive look at how organizations measure and improve their LLM applications' performance.

The series concluded with two crucial operational aspects: "[Optimizing LLM Performance and Cost](https://www.zenml.io/blog/optimizing-llm-performance-and-cost-squeezing-every-drop-of-value)", which examined the practical trade-offs in scaling LLM infrastructure, and "[Production LLM Security](https://www.zenml.io/blog/production-llm-security-real-world-strategies-from-industry-leaders)", offering essential insights into protecting LLM applications against emerging threats.

Each blog post distilled key patterns and anti-patterns from our database of case studies, providing actionable insights for practitioners at every stage of their LLMOps journey. Given the extensive scope of the database, we've created these high-level summaries to offer another way to explore the wealth of implementation details and lessons learned.

What follows are summaries of the summaries, which is to say high-level summaries of the key parts of each case study, from the problems that companies faced to the solutions they tried out. This is a long blog post but it's rewarding just to scroll through and see what jumps out for you.

Going forward, we'll continue to expand the database with new technical write-ups and panel discussions as they emerge. We're also planning regular thematic deep-dives that explore specific aspects of AI Engineering and production GenAI deployments, helping practitioners stay current with evolving best practices and emerging patterns.
