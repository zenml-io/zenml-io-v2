I have a Discord channel I check too often. It's the AI news firehose: model releases, harness papers, durable execution drama, the occasional Karpathy tweet. Most of it is noise. Some of it genuinely matters. The signal-to-noise is bad enough that I avoid the channel for a few days and then drown when I open it again.

So I built myself a small agent. It reads across a few sources, scores what it finds, and prints a short brief I can read in two minutes. I put it on Kitaru and PydanticAI mostly because we use Kitaru ourselves and I wanted a non-trivial example to break, replay, and poke at on a real workload. The full thing lives at [examples/end_to_end/news_scout](https://github.com/zenml-io/kitaru/tree/develop/examples/end_to_end/news_scout).

## What it actually does

The agent has four tools: `search_news` (Hacker News + Google News), `search_twitter` (Grok with live X access), `investigate` (fetches and reads a URL), and `fetch_url` (raw HTTP, escape hatch). The system prompt is short. It tells the agent to search across the user's interests, investigate promising headlines before judging them, score 0–10, and stop after 8–15 tool calls.

```python
scout_agent = KitaruAgent(
    Agent(
        "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
        name="news_scout",
        tools=[search_news, search_twitter, investigate, fetch_url],
        system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    ),
    granular_checkpoints=True,
    capture=CapturePolicy(tool_capture="full"),
)
```

The inner `Agent(...)` is a regular [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev) agent. Same API anyone using PydanticAI already knows. The only Kitaru-specific thing is the `KitaruAgent(...)` wrapper around it. The adapter sits in the middle: PydanticAI keeps owning the agent loop and the model I/O, Kitaru keeps owning durability. If you already have a PydanticAI agent, you drop in one import and one wrapper and you're done. You don't learn a new agent framework, and you don't give up checkpointing to stay in the one you already use.

The `capture=CapturePolicy(tool_capture="full")` flag saves tool arguments and results as artifacts on every call. That's what makes the dashboard actually useful for debugging. Click a failed `investigate` call, see which URL the agent tried, see what came back.

## Granular checkpoints

The `granular_checkpoints=True` flag is doing most of the work here. Every model request and every tool call inside the agent loop becomes its own Kitaru checkpoint that you can cache and replay on its own.

A typical run is 8–15 tool calls. Any one of them can flake: a paywall, a rate limit, a flaky DNS resolver on one article. Without granular checkpoints, recovering from a single dead URL means rerunning the whole agent from scratch — replanning, re-searching, re-investigating. With them on, I replay from exactly the failed call:

```bash
kitaru executions replay <exec_id> --from investigate_tool_5
```

Granular is right for *this* agent because the work is exploratory. The agent decides what to do at runtime. For a coding agent that runs a fixed set of phases (analyze, explore, plan, edit, test), I'd checkpoint at the phase, not the individual tool call. The shape of the work should decide where you draw the checkpoint.

## A named final artifact

Granular has a downside I hit immediately. A 12-call run produces 12 checkpoints, plus the model requests in between. When I open a run in the dashboard to read the brief, I don't want to scroll past every tool call to find it.

So the flow ends with one extra checkpoint that promotes the agent's text into a named artifact:

```python
@checkpoint
def publish_report(report_text: str) -> Annotated[str, "final_report"]:
    return report_text

@flow(image=SCOUT_IMAGE)
def news_scout(interests: list[str]) -> str:
    user_prompt = build_user_prompt(interests)
    result = scout_agent.run_sync(
        user_prompt,
        usage_limits=UsageLimits(request_limit=50),
    )
    return publish_report(report_text=result.output)
```

The `Annotated[str, "final_report"]` part is the trick. It gives the artifact a stable name on the flow, so every run has a `final_report` I can pull up directly in the dashboard. The granular trace is still there if I want to inspect what the agent did. I just don't have to wade through it to read the output.

`UsageLimits(request_limit=50)` is the boring half. Agents that loop forever are an old footgun. I'm not above admitting I've hit it.

## Memory belongs outside the flow

The scout's interests are the kind of state that should outlive a run. They change rarely, they're personal, and I don't want to retype them every time. Kitaru's namespace memory is the right place for them — but *where* you read them matters.

```python
def main():
    memory.configure(scope=NAMESPACE, scope_type="namespace")
    interests_from_memory = memory.get("interests")
    interests = override or interests_from_memory or DEFAULT_INTERESTS
    news_scout.run(interests=interests)
```

I read interests outside the flow, in `main()`, and pass them in as an argument. My first instinct was to call `memory.get` inside the flow body. That doesn't work cleanly with granular-mode agents: they run at flow scope, and flow scope wants concrete values, not DAG references. Reading once in `main()` and passing the value in keeps the flow signature clean and the replay deterministic.

Seeding is a separate one-liner CLI command:

```bash
python scout.py --seed-profile           # uses my defaults
python scout.py --interests "robotics,biotech"
```

## Secrets that don't travel through the image

When I first wrote this I was propagating `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` directly into `ImageSettings.environment`. That ships the value into Docker build metadata, image layers, and build logs — fine as a laptop-grade toy, corrosive in a quiet way the moment anyone else runs it, because a leaked image doesn't feel like a leaked secret until someone pulls its history.

The 0.5.1 release added `ImageSettings.secret_environment_from`, which is the same idea minus the leak surface. The flow references a secret by **name**; ZenML resolves it at step dispatch time and injects the values into the pod's environment — not into image layers, not into logs, not into the frozen execution spec.

```python
SCOUT_IMAGE = ImageSettings(
    requirements=["pydantic-ai-slim[anthropic,openai]>=1.75,<1.80"],
    environment=_collect_non_secret_env(),    # model overrides only, no keys
)

# On remote stacks, main() injects this at .run() time:
run_kwargs["image"] = {
    "requirements": [...],
    "environment": _collect_non_secret_env(),
    "secret_environment_from": ["news-scout-keys"],
}
```

One-time setup for the remote path:

```bash
kitaru secrets set news-scout-keys --ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... --XAI_API_KEY=xai-...
```

Local runs on the default stack still read `.env` via `load_dotenv()`, so experimenting locally needs no secret setup.

## What I'd do differently

A few honest gaps I'd rather call out than paper over.

First, deduplication. Each run sees the world fresh, so the same article can turn up in two consecutive briefs. The clean fix is to have the agent emit structured JSON with article fingerprints, then a `record_seen` checkpoint writes those into memory. I haven't done it yet.

Second, alerting. The scout currently prints to my terminal and calls it a day. A cron that runs it at 8am and posts the brief to a Discord webhook would be a much bigger win than it sounds.

The last one is the one I actually want to solve: feedback. I have no way to thumbs-up or thumbs-down an article so the agent learns my taste over time. I also have the least idea how to do it well. Embedding the feedback in namespace memory is the obvious start, but "learns my taste" is doing a lot of work in that sentence.

Any of these is a fun starter project if you want to learn Kitaru on something real.

## Try it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenml-io/kitaru
cd kitaru
uv sync --extra local --extra pydantic-ai --extra llm
kitaru init

# Drop your keys in examples/end_to_end/news_scout/.env, then:
cd examples/end_to_end/news_scout
python scout.py --seed-profile
python scout.py --interests "ai agents, robotics"
```

Then break it on purpose. Kill the process mid-sweep, replay from a tool call, and watch the cached checkpoints flick past while only the failed call re-executes. That's the moment it clicks.
