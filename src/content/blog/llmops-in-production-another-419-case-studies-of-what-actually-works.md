Seventeen months ago, we began a project to document how companies were *actually* putting Large Language Models and GenAI workflows into production. We weren't interested in hype or Twitter demos; we wanted to find the engineering reality behind the buzz. What started as a collection of 300 entries has now grown into the largest curated repository of its kind.

Today, the [ZenML LLMOps Database](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database) holds **1,182 production case studies**.

This represents a massive corpus of engineering wisdom:

<ul><li><strong>7.3 million tokens</strong> of source material read and analyzed.</li><li><strong>4 million tokens</strong> of summaries generated.</li><li><strong>17 months</strong> of continuous curation.</li></ul>

In our previous updates ([back in January](https://www.zenml.io/blog/llmops-in-production-457-case-studies-of-what-actually-works) and [later in the spring](https://www.zenml.io/blog/llmops-in-production-287-more-case-studies-of-what-actually-works)), we shared batches of these summaries to help practitioners get a sense of the variety of approaches in the wild. Since our last update, we’ve added 419 new entries, covering everything from multi-agent architectures in manufacturing to HIPAA-compliant RAG systems in healthcare.

We know that navigating over a thousand case studies is a tall order. While we are currently working on a dedicated "State of LLMOps" analysis to bring you up to date with the recent months' developments — a deep dive into the patterns and insights from recent months that we will publish later this week — sometimes the raw data is just as valuable as the synthesis.

Below, we are publishing the latest batch of high-level summaries. These are short, scannable abstracts of the problems companies faced and the specific solutions they engineered. Whether you are looking for architectural inspiration or just curious about what your peers are building, this list offers a transparent window into the current state of the industry.
