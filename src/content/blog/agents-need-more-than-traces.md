You're building an agent that does deep research. It runs for an hour, makes 40 tool calls, burns $25 in tokens. At step 38, it hits a rate limit and crashes.

You open your tracing dashboard. You can see exactly what happened; every LLM call, every tool invocation, the exact error. Beautiful.

Now what?

You start the agent again from scratch. Another hour. Another $25.

## The gap between seeing and doing

Tracing is essential. You need to know what your agent did, how long it took, where it failed. But knowing is only half the problem. The other half is *acting on it*.

What you actually want:

- **Resume from step 38.** The first 37 steps already succeeded. Their outputs are sitting right there. Why re-compute them?
- **Swap the failing input.** Maybe the rate limit was on one specific API. You want to retry step 38 with a different provider, keeping everything else.
- **Pause the next run at step 20.** You know the agent makes a questionable decision there. You want to review it before letting it continue.

These aren't observability problems. They're control problems.

## What control looks like in practice

Here's a Kitaru flow with checkpoints:

```python
import kitaru
from kitaru import checkpoint, flow

@checkpoint
def gather_sources(topic: str) -> list[str]:
    return search_academic_papers(topic)

@checkpoint
def analyze(sources: list[str]) -> str:
    return call_llm(f"Analyze these sources: {sources}")

@flow
def research_agent(topic: str) -> str:
    sources = gather_sources(topic)

    # Agent pauses here until a human approves
    approved = kitaru.wait(
        schema=bool,
        question=f"Found {len(sources)} sources. Continue?",
    )
    if not approved:
        return "Stopped by reviewer."

    return analyze(sources)
```

Each `@checkpoint` persists its return value. If `analyze` fails, you don't re-run `gather_sources`; its output is cached. You fix the issue and replay from the failure point.

The `wait()` call is a real suspension. The process stops. No polling loop. No compute burning. When the human approves, from the CLI, the API, or an AI assistant via MCP, the flow resumes from exactly where it paused.

## Not another runtime

There are durable execution engines that solve this. They're powerful but also heavy; a separate runtime to deploy, a new SDK to learn, infrastructure to manage, and much more to take care of.

Kitaru takes a different approach: two decorators and `pip install`. Your code stays Python and your control flow stays yours: if/else, loops, try/except, all work naturally. The durability is invisible until you need it.

## What this means for agent builders

When every step is checkpointed, new patterns emerge:

**Cost control:** You stop re-burning tokens on steps that already worked. A 40-step agent that fails at step 38 costs you 2 steps to retry, not 40.

**Human oversight:** You can insert approval gates anywhere in your flow. The agent pauses, the human reviews, the agent continues, no architectural changes needed, just add `wait()`.

**Debugging by replay:** Something went wrong at step 15? Replay from step 14 with different inputs, compare both runs, and iterate until it works.

**Multi-agent coordination:** One agent can read another agent's artifacts. A master agent can monitor, resume, and feed input to a fleet of sub-agents; all through the same API.

Your agents are getting more complex. Your infrastructure should make that manageable, not painful.
