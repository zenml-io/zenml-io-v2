The agent stack has four layers: the model (the LLM itself), the harness (the loop around the model), the runtime (how it survives and executes over time), and the platform (how the org governs it). They usually get collapsed into one.

For a single agent in a single harness, collapsing them is fine. The place where you write the prompt, the place where a run survives a crash, and the place where someone in your org decides whether you're allowed to run this all end up in one file on your laptop. That stops working the moment two teams in your org pick different harnesses. The durability you thought you had was harness-coupled. The replay lived inside the graph. The "wait for a human" was a blocking `input()`. None of it transfers to the agent someone else built in a different harness.

This post pulls the layers apart. The runtime layer is where most of the durability work lives, and inside it there's a second split — runner vs execution target — that matters more than most current tooling acknowledges.

## Four layers

**Model.** The LLM itself — a compute unit over a context window. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, open-weights, fine-tuned in-house. Picked for capability and cost; everything upstream wraps this.

**Harness.** The loop around the model. Prompts, tool loops, model calls, structured output, context management, in-turn memory. Pydantic AI / Pydantic AI Harness, LangGraph, the Claude Agent SDK, the OpenAI Agents SDK, hand-rolled loops. Harness design is a very active area — it's how much you get out of whatever model you picked.

**Runtime.** How the agent survives and executes over time. Checkpoints, replay, resume, wait states, versioned deployments, invocation routing, artifact and state persistence, execution placement. The part that doesn't change when the harness changes. The part nobody ships by default.

**Platform.** How the org governs. Auth, entitlements, request interceptors, guardrails, observability pipelines, product UI, policy engines. Usually already exists at your company, ten years before anyone said the word "agent."

The split is cleaner on paper than in most products. LangGraph is a harness and also runs its own checkpointer and time-travel inside its graph model. LangSmith Deployment packages runtime plus sandboxes plus auth proxy as a hosted product. Those hybrids are fine; they just have an opinion about the other layers, and if your org doesn't match the opinion, adoption gets friction.

## The questions each layer answers

To place any tool in this space, ask which of these questions it actually answers:

- *Which LLM is actually generating tokens, and at what cost/context window?* → model
- *How is the model driven in a single turn — prompts, tools, output schema?* → harness
- *What does its output look like when a downstream system has to consume it?* → harness
- *What happens when the pod running this agent dies at step 4 of 7?* → runtime
- *How do I roll a new version of this agent out to 5% of traffic?* → runtime
- *Where do the intermediate artifacts of the last 10,000 runs live?* → runtime
- *Who is allowed to invoke this flow?* → platform
- *How do we prove this agent only read data the caller is authorized to see?* → platform
- *What does our SRE team get paged on when this misbehaves?* → platform

Most of the confusion between tools here is a tool answering one of these questions while the reader hears the answer to a different one. Know which question you need answered, and the layer the tool sits in becomes obvious.

## What you lose when you compress

When the layers compress into a single piece of software, you typically lose durability, and you lose it in a way that isn't obvious until production.

A harness-native durable runtime stores checkpoints indexed by graph node, or workflow step, or some abstraction internal to the harness. That's great for agents written in that harness. An agent written in a different harness on the same org's infrastructure gets none of it. Its crashes are full crashes. Its waits are blocking. Its deploys are bespoke.

A platform team with two or three harnesses in the org has two options:

1. Mandate one harness across the org, so the harness-native durability covers everything.
2. Put durability underneath the harness, at a layer all harnesses can share.

The first option is hard to land. Teams pick harnesses for real reasons — type ergonomics, graph-native reasoning, specific tool integrations — and forcing convergence usually creates more friction than it saves. The second option is what a runtime layer is for. It's the only option that scales with harness plurality.

The other thing you lose when you compress is the ability to reason about failure. "The sandbox died" is not the same as "the run failed." "The agent crashed" is not the same as "this step can't complete." Durable execution is a property of the runtime around the code; a bounded sandbox is a property of where the code runs. If one team says "we have sandboxes" and another hears "so you have durable execution," you'll find out the difference in production.

## Runner vs execution target

Inside the runtime layer there's a second split, and it's the part that gets discussed least.

For every flow invocation, there's a **runner**: the durable brain of that one run. It holds checkpoint order. It persists state after every boundary. It handles retry, replay, resume, and `wait`. It's per-run, and it survives transient failures of the code it's running.

Separately, there's an **execution target**: the actual thing that runs the code inside a given checkpoint. Inline (same process as the runner), isolated (a separate container or Kubernetes job), sandbox (restricted egress, model-generated code), or an external tool (an MCP server, an internal API).

Checkpoints are the contract between them.

Once the runner is separate from the execution target, a lot of things stop being contradictions:

- A checkpoint can fail without the run failing. The runner holds the pre-failure state; the checkpoint's output becomes a typed error artifact; retry, replay, and human correction all become data, not crashes.
- Different checkpoints in the same run can have different execution policies. Inline for cheap orchestration, isolated for untrusted code, sandbox for anything model-generated, external tool for capabilities outside Kitaru's scope. The runner doesn't care; it waits on results.
- Scaling the runtime doesn't mean scaling everything. The runner is lightweight — it's orchestration. The execution targets are where the compute is, and they scale independently per workload shape.

The test for whether a system has made this split cleanly: *if the sandbox dies mid-step, does the run die?* If yes, you have a sandbox with retries. If no — if the runner is still holding state and can retry, replay, or resume at exactly the checkpoint that was in flight — you have durable execution.

Most agent runtime design in 2026 still conflates these.

## Why failed checkpoints are durable context

A direct consequence of the runner/execution-target split: a failed checkpoint isn't a crash. It's durable context.

When a checkpoint fails, the runner captures the error, the input that produced it, and the state of the run up to that point. That's data, and data can be acted on:

- Retry the same checkpoint with the same input (transient failures).
- Replay with a modified input (bad data upstream, fixed, then replayed).
- Replay with modified code (bug in the agent logic; fix, redeploy, replay).
- Feed the error artifact back into the agent loop so the model can see what went wrong and correct itself.
- Pause the run until a human approves a correction via `wait()`, then resume.

Every one of those options requires the runner to still be running. None of them work if the failure killed the run. That's the operational gap between agents that run as production systems and agents that run as scripts.

## Buying vs building

This is orthogonal to the layer split but worth naming.

If you're buying an agent stack — you want a hosted control plane, you're fine with someone else's UI, you don't want to operate the runtime — a packaged product (LangSmith Deployment is the obvious current example) is probably the right shape. Fewer pieces to wire up.

If you're building one — your platform already runs on your infra, you have auth, you have observability, and you need the durable-execution layer specifically — a runtime primitive without the rest is the right shape. You're not buying a platform; you already have one. You're filling in the runtime layer.

The "too much tool" and "not enough tool" reactions in this space are almost always about which of these two situations the reader is in.

## Closing

The layers are real. Conflating them costs durability. The split inside the runtime — runner vs execution target — is where most of the architectural work lives, and is the part most current tooling still leaves implicit.

If you're a platform engineer with more than one agent harness showing up in your org, the runtime layer is the one I'd think about first. There are several projects in it now — LangGraph's checkpointer, LangSmith Deployment, Temporal, DBOS, [Kitaru](https://kitaru.ai/docs/concepts/harness-runtime-platform) — each with real tradeoffs and a real audience. Which one you pick matters less than recognizing that the runtime layer is its own layer and needs its own answer.
