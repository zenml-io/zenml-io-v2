We have identified a critical security vulnerability in ZenML versions prior to 0.46.7 which has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2024-25723. This vulnerability potentially allows unauthorized users to take ownership of ZenML accounts through the user activation feature.

## Affected Versions:

All ZenML versions below 0.46.7 are vulnerable, with the exception of the following patch versions: (0.44.4, 0.43.1, 0.42.2).

## Vulnerability Details:

The issue lies in the `/api/v1/users/{user_name_or_id}/activate` REST API endpoint. An existing username, along with a new password provided in the request body, can be misused to gain unauthorized access.

## Immediate Action Required:

We strongly urge all ZenML users to immediately upgrade to the latest version (0.46.7 or above) or one of the patched versions (0.44.4, 0.43.1, 0.42.2) to mitigate this risk.

**How to Upgrade**:

<ul id=""><li id="">For direct installations, use pip install "zenml==0.46.7" (or the respective patched version). (Note that the current latest version is 0.55.2, released last week.)</li><li id="">For containerized or orchestrated environments, update your ZenML container image or deployment configuration to use the new version.</li><li id="">Ensure that any automated deployment pipelines are also updated accordingly.</li></ul>

## ZenML Cloud Users:

We have already patched ZenML Cloud versions to address this vulnerability. No action is required for ZenML Cloud users.
