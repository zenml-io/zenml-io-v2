In this blog, we will compare ZenML and Apache Airflow, examining their strengths, use cases, and how they stack up against each other in the context of managing machine learning workflows.

## What is orchestration?

[Workflow orchestration](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-orchestration) involves the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex tasks across computer systems and services. Its primary goal is to ensure that processes are executed in the correct order and at the right time, minimizing manual intervention and errors. Orchestration is crucial across various fields. In data engineering and ETL pipelines, it ensures that data flows smoothly, transformations are applied correctly, and processes run efficiently from source to destination. In DevOps, orchestration automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications, streamlining CI/CD pipelines and simplifying the management of complex microservices architectures. It also plays a key role in cloud computing, managing the deployment and scaling of cloud resources to optimize utilization and reduce costs. Additionally, in IT operations, orchestration automates routine tasks like system monitoring, backups, and patch management, keeping systems secure and up-to-date.Orchestration is vital for managing the intricate steps of developing, training, and deploying machine learning (ML) models. Through MLOps practices, orchestration ensures that ML workflows are streamlined, scalable, and integrated with existing IT and DevOps processes, reducing errors and accelerating model deployment. By automating these complex workflows, orchestration not only enhances efficiency but also ensures that ML models are maintained and updated consistently, making it a critical component in the production lifecycle of machine learning projects.

## Orchestration In MLOps:

**Selecting the right MLOps tool** is crucial for organizations to streamline and scale their ML workflows, impacting efficiency, effectiveness, and business outcomes as the right tool helps in:

**1. Pipeline Automation and Workflow Efficiency**

Tools like Airflow, Kubeflow, and ZenML automate and orchestrate ML pipelines, streamlining the entire ML lifecycle from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, deployment, and monitoring. These platforms enable efficient resource management and faster iteration cycles, as well as ensure continuous model performance in production environments.

**2. Scalable Infrastructure and Resource Management**

Collaboration and Reproducibility: MLOps platforms like MLflow and Kubeflow enhance team collaboration by providing shared environments and integrated version control. They ensure reproducibility by tracking datasets, code, model versions, and experiment configurations. For example, MLflow logs experiments and parameters, while Kubeflow offers detailed lineage tracking, ensuring models can be consistently reproduced and audited across different stages of the ML lifecycle.

**3. Collaborative Development and Reproducible Workflows**

MLOps tools, like MLflow and Kubeflow, enhance team collaboration through shared environments and integrated version control. They ensure reproducibility by tracking data, code, and model versions. For instance, MLflow logs all experiments, including parameters and results, while Kubeflow provides detailed lineage tracking. This allows teams to reproduce and audit models consistently across development and production stages, maintaining consistency and reliability.

**4. Observability and Continuous Model Governance**

MLOps platforms, such as SageMaker and Databricks, offer real-time insights into model performance, enabling teams to monitor critical metrics like accuracy and latency continuously. They also ensure compliance with regulatory standards by providing robust auditing and logging features. For example, SageMaker includes built-in tools for tracking model drift, while Databricks supports automated compliance checks, helping organizations meet stringent regulatory requirements.

**5. Elasticity and Interoperability**

For example, Azure Machine Learning offers built-in security features like encryption and role-based access control. At the same time, SageMaker provides model monitoring and anomaly detection to protect sensitive models and data throughout the ML lifecycle.

## Community Highlight

[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), initially developed by [Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/airflow-a-workflow-management-platform-46318b977fd8) and later adopted by the Apache Software Foundation, is widely used for orchestrating complex workflows, particularly in data pipelines and ETL processes. It has gained a strong community known for its active engagement across various platforms and offers a wealth of resources, making it a reliable choice for workflow orchestration. Airflow allows users to define workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) using Python, providing a flexible and scalable framework. Its robust ecosystem and community involvement in meetups and conferences further strengthen its position as a leading tool in the workflow orchestration space.

[ZenML](https://www.zenml.io/) is an open-source MLOps framework that is rapidly growing in the machine learning operations space. Despite being newer and having a smaller community than established tools, ZenML's community is highly engaged and actively growing. The core team is very responsive, interacting with users through Slack, GitHub Discussions, and webinars. ZenML's comprehensive documentation and tutorials make it easy for users to get started and contribute. The contribution-friendly community fosters collaboration and innovation and is designed to integrate seamlessly with popular ML libraries, tools, and infrastructure. ZenML emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and extensibility, enabling data scientists and engineers to build reproducible and production-ready ML pipelines. As ZenML continues to gain traction, it is becoming an excellent choice for those focusing on modern MLOps.

Both tools automate workflows but cater to different needs. ZenML is designed for machine learning operations, where workloads often involve compute-intensive tasks like model training. It abstracts away infrastructure complexities, allowing data scientists and ML engineers to focus on resources like GPUs, memory, and CPUs without worrying about underlying systems. In contrast, Apache Airflow is built to orchestrate less compute-intensive workflows, such as data pipelines, and is favored by data engineers who are more concerned with concepts like backfills, schedules, and transformations. This makes ZenML ideal for ML tasks and Airflow a solid choice for data pipeline orchestration.

## Understanding Apache Airflow

[Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow) is an open-source platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows. Its extensible Python framework enables you to build workflows connecting virtually any technology. A web interface helps manage the state of your workflows. Airflow is deployable in many ways, from a single process on your laptop to a distributed setup to support even the biggest workflows.

### Where does Airflow fall short?

Using Apache Airflow as an MLOps orchestrator presents several challenges, as it was not originally designed with machine learning workflows in mind. Commonly cited issues include the lack of native support for ML-specific tasks, the complexity of integrating machine learning libraries, and the manual effort required for experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment. While Airflow's flexibility and extensibility make it a powerful tool for general workflow orchestration, these same features can make it cumbersome and inefficient for MLOps use cases, as discussed frequently in community forums like Reddit. In the following sections, we'll explore these challenges in detail and how they impact the effectiveness of using Airflow for machine learning operations.

</figure>

1. [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/10ttbvl/why_everybodys_using_airflow_while_noone_seems_to/) discusses why Apache Airflow, despite being widely used in data engineering, often receives mixed reviews. Many users appreciate its capabilities but acknowledge that it was not designed with machine learning (ML) pipelines in mind. This can lead to frustration when using Airflow for ML workflows, which are typically more compute-intensive and have different requirements than the data pipelines Airflow excels at managing. As a result, there's growing interest in exploring tools better suited for ML tasks.

## ZenML vs. Apache Airflow: Side-by-Side Code Comparison

Below is a side-by-side comparison of how ZenML and Apache Airflow handle a basic machine learning pipeline. The example will illustrate defining, scheduling, and running a simple pipeline in both frameworks.

### Basic Pipeline Setup

##### ZenML Code

Here is an example of how you could write a simple machine learning pipeline with ZenML. Since the code remains the same no matter what infrastructure or orchestration backend you use, this code could run on Airflow as is.

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>from zenml import pipeline, step
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

def load_data() -&gt; tuple:
 &nbsp; &nbsp;iris = load_iris()
 &nbsp; &nbsp;X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
 &nbsp; &nbsp;return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

# Step to train the model
@step
def train_model(X_train: list, y_train: list) -&gt; RandomForestClassifier:
 &nbsp; &nbsp;model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
 &nbsp; &nbsp;model.fit(X_train, y_train)
 &nbsp; &nbsp;return model

# Step to evaluate the model
@step
def evaluate_model(model: RandomForestClassifier, X_test: list, y_test: list) -&gt; float:
 &nbsp; &nbsp;predictions = model.predict(X_test)
 &nbsp; &nbsp;accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
 &nbsp; &nbsp;return accuracy

# Define the ZenML pipeline
@pipeline
def ml_workflow_pipeline():
 &nbsp; &nbsp;X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data()
 &nbsp; &nbsp;model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
 &nbsp; &nbsp;accuracy = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)

# Run the ZenML pipeline
if __name__ == "__main__":
 &nbsp; &nbsp;ml_workflow_pipeline()</code></pre></div>

#### Airflow Code

If you were just using raw Airflow code, this is an example of what your pipeline might look like:`‍`

## Airflow + ZenML = Airflow++

<ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Standalone Airflow</strong> is best for projects heavily focused on data engineering, ETL processes, and workflow automation across various systems and platforms.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Standalone ZenML</strong> is ideal for MLOps-focused projects where reproducibility, model management, and integration with ML tools are the top priorities.</li><li id=""><a href="https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/airflow" id=""><strong id="">Airflow + ZenML</strong></a> is a powerful combination for projects requiring data engineering and machine learning capabilities. This setup allows teams to manage complex data workflows with Airflow while using ZenML to handle the unique demands of MLOps, providing a comprehensive solution for end-to-end data and ML workflows.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Steps to Run Pipelines with</strong> Airflow <strong id="">Orchestrator</strong></li><li id="">ZenML pipelines can run as <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/" id="">Airflow</a> DAGs, combining Airflow's orchestration with ZenML's ML-specific benefits.

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>zenml integration install airflow</code></pre></div>

<ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">STEP 2:</strong> Prerequisites</li></ul>

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running.

<ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">STEP 3: The orchestrator registered and part of our active stack:</strong></li></ul>

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>zenml orchestrator register ORCHESTRATOR_NAME&nbsp;--flavor=airflow&nbsp;--local=True</code></pre></div>

If you are using a remote Airflow deployment you can set `--local=True` to `False`.

Now register and activate a stack with the new orchestrator:

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>zenml stack register STACK_NAME -o ORCHESTRATOR_NAME ... --set</code></pre></div>

<ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Step 4: Set Up a Local Airflow Server Environment</strong></li></ul>

Since running Airflow locally can sometimes lead to dependency conflicts, it’s recommended to create a separate virtual environment for the Airflow server:

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>python -m venv airflow_server_env
source airflow_server_env/bin/activate</code></pre></div>

Then install any needed requirements:

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>pip install "apache-airflow==2.4.0" "apache-airflow-providers-docker&lt;3.8.0" "pydantic~=2.7.1"</code></pre></div>

<ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Step 5: Start the Local Airflow Server</strong></li></ul>

Before running your ZenML pipeline, you need to start the local Airflow server. You can set environment variables to configure the Airflow server. For example:

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow
export AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER=~/airflow/dags</code></pre></div>

Start the Airflow server:

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>airflow standalone</code></pre></div>

This will start the Airflow web server and scheduler locally. You can access the Airflow UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

<ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Step 6: Run a ZenML Pipeline</strong></li></ul>

Now that Airflow is set up, you can run your ZenML pipeline. First switch back to the environment where ZenML is installed:

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>source your_zenml_env/bin/activate</code></pre></div>

Run the pipeline:

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>python my_pipeline_script.py</code></pre></div>

After running your pipeline, ZenML will create a `.zip` file representing it. This file will be stored in the logs directory. To enable Airflow to execute it, you must move the `.zip` file to the Airflow DAGs directory.

<ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Step 7: Copy the DAG to the Airflow DAGs Directory</strong></li></ul>

By default, ZenML won't automatically place the DAG in the Airflow directory. You can either manually copy it or configure ZenML to do it for you. Switch to the Python environment that has ZenML installed before running these two commands:

<div data-rt-embed-type="true"><pre><code>zenml orchestrator update --dag_output_dir=<airflow_dag_directory>
python file_that_runs_a_zenml_pipeline.py</airflow_dag_directory></code></pre></div>

‍

<ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">You can now run any ZenML pipeline using the Airflow orchestrator:</strong></li></ul>
