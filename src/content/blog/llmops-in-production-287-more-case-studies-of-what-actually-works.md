Back in January [we published summaries](https://www.zenml.io/blog/llmops-in-production-457-case-studies-of-what-actually-works) of the 457 case studies that constituted [the LLMOps Database](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database) at the time. We've since added a bunch more and so we're publishing the latest summaries below since it's a nicer way to get a sense of the variety of approaches and use cases in play in 2025.

I see four bigger trends in the latest batch:

## Agents Are Being Used in Production (Finally!)

After years of demos and promises, we're finally seeing agent systems handling real workloads in production. But the agents that actually work look nothing like the autonomous, general-purpose systems we see in research papers (or are promised by big tech companies).

The successful production agents are surprisingly narrow. They're single-domain specialists, operating under more-or-less constant human supervision. Think of them less as autonomous entities and more as really smart, context-aware automation scripts. [Deutsche Telekom's customer service platform](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/building-a-multi-agent-llm-platform-for-customer-service-automation) is a perfect example - it's an agent system, sure, but one that operates within extremely well-defined boundaries with clear escalation paths to humans.

What's particularly telling is that only about 20% of the agent stories in our database involve true multi-agent architectures. And even those are often just orchestrator-worker patterns dressed up in fancy terminology. The "multi-agent" label is doing a lot of heavy lifting here - many of these systems are essentially a main controller delegating specific tasks to specialized sub-modules.

The vertical agents are where things get interesting though. When you constrain the problem space enough - say, to handling insurance claims or scheduling maintenance tasks - you can build systems that genuinely augment human capabilities rather than just automating rote tasks.

## Evals Are the Critical Path

Perhaps this is a truism by now, but it seems so clear as of writing in July 2025 that you'll spend more time building evaluation infrastructure than you will on the actual application logic. And if you're not, you're probably shipping broken features (or you don't care about your users / product).

LLM-as-judge has emerged as the dominant pattern for reference-free scoring, and for good reason - it scales. But don't let anyone tell you it's a complete solution. Every single successful deployment we've analyzed maintains human-in-the-loop golden datasets for their critical domains. The pattern is consistent: start with LLM judges for velocity, but anchor everything to human-validated or human-aligned ground truth.

Cost awareness is the new reality check. Teams are discovering that running comprehensive evals on every commit can burn through their inference budget faster than actual production traffic. [Notion AI's approach](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/scaling-ai-product-development-with-rigorous-evaluation-and-observability) shows how to balance this - they've built a multi-layer eval stack that runs lightweight unit tests frequently, with more expensive offline regression tests gated behind specific triggers.

The most sophisticated teams are running what amounts to defense-in-depth for LLM outputs: unit tests for prompt templates, offline regression suites for model updates, and online guardrails that act as runtime confidence filters. It's not elegant, but it works.

## RAG Is Still a Thing (But It's Getting Weird)

Remember when RAG was just "stick your docs in a vector database and hope for the best"? Those days are long gone. What we're seeing now is new RAG architectures (and a bunch of new coinages and acronyms to boot).

The complexity explosion is real. [Writer's graph-based RAG system](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/enterprise-scale-llm-deployment-with-self-evolving-models-and-graph-based-rag) exemplifies this new breed - they're not just storing embeddings, they're maintaining knowledge graphs that evolve based on usage patterns. We're talking about systems that combine vector search, keyword matching, graph traversal, and reranking pipelines, all orchestrated by yet another LLM.

The surprising part? This complexity sometimes pays off. The vanilla RAG pattern can hit a quality ceiling quickly (depending on your application's complexity), but these baroque architectures can push accuracy into the 90%+ range for domain-specific queries. The trade-off is operational complexity.

## Data Flywheels Are the Moat

Here's the pattern that separates the winners from the also-rans: every sustained success story has figured out how to turn user interactions into training data. Not in some abstract "we'll analyze this someday" way, but as a core part of their product loop.

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), [Zapier Agents](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/building-production-ai-agents-platform-for-non-technical-users), [Notion AI](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/scaling-ai-product-development-with-rigorous-evaluation-and-observability), and [Propel's SNAP benefits assistant](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/building-and-automating-comprehensive-llm-evaluation-framework-for-snap-benefits) all share this DNA. When users correct the AI's output, that correction doesn't just fix the immediate problem - it feeds back into the system, updating prompts, fine-tuning models, or adjusting retrieval strategies.

The clever bit is how teams are bootstrapping these flywheels. Synthetic data generation has emerged as the go-to strategy for cold starts. [Pinterest's search relevance work](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/large-language-models-for-search-relevance-via-knowledge-distillation) shows this perfectly - they used GPT-4 to generate training data for smaller models, creating a distillation cascade that dramatically reduced inference costs while maintaining quality.

What's fascinating is that the flywheel effect compounds faster than most teams expect. Once you have even a modest feedback loop in place, the quality improvements accelerate. The hard part isn't the technical implementation - it's designing the UX to make feedback frictionless and ensuring your legal team is comfortable with the data usage policies.

All of which is to say that we don't seem to be nearing some kind of interim stability point. 2025 and 2026 looks like we'll continue to see LLMOps architecture and infrastructure continue to evolve as new capabilities and techniques emerge.
