**Last updated:** July 7, 2022.

I’ll be having some conversations with the people behind the tools that ZenML offers as integrations. We [spoke with Ben Wilson](https://podcast.zenml.io/ml-engineering-ben-wilson) a few weeks back, and today I’m pleased to publish this conversation with [Emeli Dral](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emelidral/), co-founder and CTO of [Evidently](https://evidentlyai.com/), an open-source tool tackling the problem of monitoring of models and data for machine learning.

We discussed the challenges around building a tool that is both straightforward to use while also customizable and powerful. We also got into the thinking behind how they grew their community and blog along the way.
