We're excited to announce the release of ZenML 0.66.0! This update brings some highly anticipated features, optimizations, and quality-of-life improvements to streamline your ML pipelines even further. Here’s a breakdown of what’s new in this version:

## Python 3.12 Support

**‍**ZenML now officially supports Python 3.12! As Python continues to evolve, we’re committed to ensuring compatibility with the latest versions. This update allows you to leverage the newest features and improvements in Python without any hassle.Whether you're starting a new project or updating an existing one, ZenML 0.66.0 seamlessly integrates with Python 3.12, providing a future-proof foundation for your machine learning pipelines.

## Slimmer Client Library

**‍**In our quest to make ZenML as lightweight as possible, we've removed pandas and numpy as dependencies from the core client library. This change significantly reduces the size of ZenML installations, making the client much slimmer and faster to install, especially in environments where size matters.Don’t worry—if your pipelines require pandas or numpy, you can still use them. This change simply makes these dependencies optional rather than mandatory.

## List of All Pipeline Runs in the Dashboard

**‍**We’ve improved our dashboard with a highly requested feature: you can now view a comprehensive list of all pipeline runs directly in the ZenML dashboard. This makes monitoring and tracking your pipelines easier than ever, giving you more visibility into what’s happening across your workflows.

## Conclusion

We encourage you to update to ZenML 0.66.0 and explore these new features. As always, we welcome your feedback and look forward to seeing how these improvements accelerate your ML projects.

For a complete list of changes and improvements, please check out [our full release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/releases/tag/0.66.0).
