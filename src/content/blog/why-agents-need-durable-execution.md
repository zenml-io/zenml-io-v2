Your agent just spent 45 minutes and $30 in API calls researching a topic. It made it through 23 tool calls, synthesized data from 8 sources, and was about to write the final summary.

Then the OpenAI API returned a 429. Your agent crashed. All that work just gone.

## The problem with stateless agents

Most agent frameworks treat each run as stateless. When something fails, you start over. There's no concept of "pick up where I left off."

This is fine for short tasks like a single LLM call that fails? Retry it. But agents are getting longer and more complex:

- **Research agents** that run for hours, making dozens of API calls
- **Coding agents** that iterate through multiple rounds of write-test-fix
- **Multi-step workflows** with human approval gates in the middle

For these, starting over is not just annoying; it's wasteful. You're re-burning tokens, re-calling APIs, re-doing work that already succeeded.

## What durable execution gives you

Durable execution means every meaningful step in your agent is checkpointed. If it crashes at step 15, you restart from step 15, not step 1.

```python
from kitaru import checkpoint, flow

@checkpoint
def step_one(input: str) -> str:
    # This result is persisted
    return expensive_api_call(input)

@checkpoint
def step_two(data: str) -> str:
    # If this crashes, step_one's result is still cached
    return another_expensive_call(data)

@flow
def my_agent(input: str) -> str:
    a = step_one(input)
    b = step_two(a)
    return b
```

When you replay after a failure, `step_one` returns its cached output instantly. Only `step_two` re-executes.

## Beyond crash recovery

Once you have checkpointed execution, other things become possible:

**Human-in-the-loop:** Your agent can pause mid-execution, wait for human input, and resume later. Not with a polling loop burning compute, with actual suspension. The process stops. When input arrives, it restarts from the checkpoint.

**Replay with overrides:** Your agent made a bad decision at step 5? Go back, swap in a different input, and replay from there. All subsequent steps re-execute with the new data.

**Artifact inspection:** Every checkpoint output is a versioned artifact you can inspect, compare across runs, and query programmatically.

## Why not just use try/except?

You can add retry logic and state persistence yourself. But you'll end up rebuilding:

- Serialization for every intermediate result
- A storage layer for checkpoints
- Replay logic that skips completed steps
- A way to inspect and compare artifacts across runs

That's infrastructure work, not agent work. Kitaru handles it with decorators so you can focus on what your agent actually does.
