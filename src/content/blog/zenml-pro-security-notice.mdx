The ZenML team has addressed a security finding in ZenML Pro's role management system, reported by JFrog Security Research team. This update provides important information for users regarding role-based access controls and recommended actions.

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability exists in ZenML Pro's role management system and could allow a user with low-privilege tenant access to escalate their permissions to full admin privileges on the affected tenant. This occurs due to inconsistencies between organization-level and tenant-level role management.

**Impact:**

<ul id=""><li id="">Unauthorized elevation of privileges from viewer to admin role within a tenant</li><li id="">Potential access to sensitive tenant resources and configurations</li><li id="">Ability to modify or access unauthorized components within the affected tenant</li></ul>

## Technical Description

The vulnerability stems from a logical flaw in the role creation API endpoint. When creating a new role, the system does not properly validate the relationship between the organization ID and tenant-specific scope permissions. This allows an attacker to:

<ol id=""><li id="">Create a role in their own organization</li><li id="">Specify permissions scoped to a tenant from another organization</li><li id="">Assign themselves elevated privileges on the unauthorized tenant</li></ol>

## Current Status

<ul id=""><li id="">✅ All ZenML Pro instances have been automatically patched</li><li id="">✅ No user action is required</li><li id="">✅ The fix has been deployed across all environments</li></ul>

## Impact

There is no action required from users. All ZenML Pro instances are protected against this vulnerability.
