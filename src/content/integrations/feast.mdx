</code></pre></div>The code example demonstrates how to retrieve historical features from a Feast feature store within a ZenML pipeline step. It uses the get_historical_features method to fetch features based on the provided entity dictionary and feature list, enabling seamless integration of feature store data into the ML workflow.
