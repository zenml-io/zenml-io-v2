# Talking Points — v2 Reshoot

**IMPORTANT**: These are BULLET CUES, not a script. Don't read them word-for-word.
Tape them at EYE LEVEL next to your camera lens so you're looking straight ahead.
Speak naturally, like you're telling a friend. Hamza's note: "think American energy."

---

## Clip 1 — HOOK (aim for ~18-20s)

Full screen. Look straight at camera. High energy from the first word.

- "2,224 pages. 20 collections. 5 days. One person."
- "We didn't just migrate a website — we dissolved the lock-in."
- Pause. Let it land.

> The numbers will flash on screen as you say them. Then "Claude Code + Opus 4.6" appears.

---

## Clip 2 — WHY IT MATTERS (aim for ~25s)

PiP (you'll be small, bottom-left). Cards appear on screen as you talk.

- "$800 a year renting our own site from Webflow"
- "One person could edit at a time. Site locks when anyone's working."
- "No version control, no CI/CD, no branch previews"
- "A manual migration? That's months and six figures."
- "We did it in five days."

> 4 cards will appear staggered — pace yourself, ~4 seconds per point.

---

## Clip 3 — PLANNING (aim for ~27s)

PiP. B-roll of the LLMOps database behind you.

- "Claude didn't just write code — it planned"
- "22 planning docs. Not upfront waterfall — adaptive, phase by phase"
- "When it realized MDX would silently break 1,900 HTML files, it caught it and pivoted"
- "Self-correcting. That's what makes Opus different."

---

## Clip 4 — MULTI-MODAL (aim for ~27s)

PiP. B-roll of homepage + case study behind you.

- "The wildest capability: visual understanding"
- "Claude used Playwright to screenshot each page of the old site"
- "Extracted frames, understood the layout, then recreated it in code"
- "Not copy-paste — actual visual comprehension"

---

## Clip 5 — VERIFICATION (aim for ~25s)

PiP. B-roll of blog post + blog listing behind you.

- "Here's where it gets real: the new site scores better than the original"
- "SEO: 100. Accessibility: 100. On mobile."
- "Webflow scored 92 and 89 on desktop."
- "Every URL preserved. Every redirect. Every meta tag."

---

## Clip 6 — RESULTS & CLOSE (aim for ~40s)

Starts PiP (metric cards on screen), then YOU go full-screen for the big finish.

**First half** (~15s, PiP — metric cards visible):
- "SEO perfect. Accessibility perfect. Hosting: essentially zero dollars."
- "Build time: 33 seconds for 2,224 pages"

**Second half** (~25s, you'll be full-screen — this is the emotional peak):
- "But this isn't really about ZenML"
- "If one person can escape platform lock-in in under a week..."
- "...the technical barrier that kept the open web out of reach? It just fell."
- "Claude Code didn't automate a migration. It made an entire industry's business model optional."
- Pause. Slight smile. Let it land.

## General Tips

- **Eye contact**: Look AT the camera, not at the screen/teleprompter
- **Pace**: Slightly faster than last time. The hook especially — bang, bang, bang.
- **Pauses**: After big lines ("dissolved the lock-in", "business model optional"), PAUSE.
- **Energy**: You're not presenting a project report. You're presenting evidence.
- **Blupus**: If he shows up, roll with it. Hamza says keep him.
- **Hands**: Gesture naturally. Don't keep them still.
